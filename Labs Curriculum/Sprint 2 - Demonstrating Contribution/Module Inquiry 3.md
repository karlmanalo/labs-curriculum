# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
   
   Sourcing a data set.

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
   
   I was the driver the whole time. I have pair programmed before and I prefer being the driver because I feel that I take the time to understand a problem and excel at explaining my process to others, and many people that I've paired with don't share that same strength.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
   
   The approach to a solution that I had was different from the way the driver's approach to a solution.

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
   
   Pair programming is still something that's tough for me. I wouldn't say I'm the best coder even in our cohort at Lambda, but I do feel that I am above average in understanding when it comes to Python and solving problems in Python. This is something that will be a little less drastic in the workplace, but the people that I've been paired with, in full transparency, haven't been the strongest coders. When I'm navigating for someone that I feel is a significantly weaker coder than I am, it turns into a teaching session rather than a pair programming session. I know that there aren't many scenarios where you will be pair programming with someone that is exactly your level, but when the gulf feels that wide, pair programming just isn't very conducive to learning.

   Like another student said in lecture, when confronted with a situation like that again in the future, I will treat it as a learning experience.
