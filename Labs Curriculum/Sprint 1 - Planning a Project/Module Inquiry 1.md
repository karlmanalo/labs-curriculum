# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    - Are we only considering cities in the United States?
    - What are the most important statistics you consider when moving to a new city?
    - What components of weather should be included?
    
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    - As a user, I can compare multiple cities side by side.
    - As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city.
    - As a user, I can view the historical housing prices for a city.
    - As a user, I can view the major job industries for a city.
    
3a. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    * As a user, I can view the historical housing prices for a city.
    In order to accomplish this, the following steps need to be completed:
    Create wireframes for housing prices
    Create an endpoint to retrieve housing data given city ID
    Create and style bar chart component
    Create and style line graph component
    Get data from API and serve to frontend to render dynamic data
    All above the features have been tested and deployed
    
3b. What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    - Did well: Broke down task to small technical steps
    - Challenges: Figuring out every step from end to end that needed to be engineered.
    
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    - Even though it's been hammered into our heads over and over again, I didn't take enough time to understand the big picture of
    what needed to be accomplished. Next time, I would take a bit more time to break down individual tasks into easily digestible 
    parts.
